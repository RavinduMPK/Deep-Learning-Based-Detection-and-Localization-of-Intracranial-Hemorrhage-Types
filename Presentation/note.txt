Complete Intersection over Union (CIoU) loss
Complete Intersection over Union (CIoU) loss is a function of IoU. It's an extension of Distance-intersection over union (DIoU) loss that considers three geometric measures: 
	- Overlap area
	- Central point distance
	- Aspect ratio

CIoU loss improves the performance of detection and segmentation tasks. It converges faster with fewer iterations than IoU and GIoU. 

CIoU loss is calculated as follows: 
	D: The normalized distance Iou loss between the center point of the predicted and ground truth boxes
	V: The consistency of the aspect ratio
The aspect ratio factor is less important in the case of no overlap and more important in the case of more overlap. 


Windowing
Since the HU range for CT scans can be quite large
(typically around -1000 to 4000 HU), it is often impractical
to display the entire range of values in a single
image. We used the windowing technique to adjust the
range of pixel values that are displayed in an image,
effectively zooming in on a specific range of interest.
We used a window level of 40 and a window width of
80. This means that only HU values between -20 and
60 will be displayed, while values outside this range
will be clipped to the minimum and maximum values,
respectively. This compresses the HU range and
enhances brain tissue contrast.
